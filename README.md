## What I’ve Built and Applied

### Predictive Modeling & Analytics  
- Built regression and classification models to forecast outcomes.  
- Predicted compressive strength of concrete mixes using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ANN (R² up to 0.92).  
- Classified seabed hardness with KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, improving accuracy with feature engineering.  

### Natural Language Processing (NLP & GenAI)  
- Applied deep learning and generative AI to extract insights and generate text.  
- Built a Bi-LSTM + Attention model for abstractive summarization of consumer health questions, evaluated with ROUGE metrics.  
- Leveraged embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to improve semantic representation for summarization and classification tasks.  

### Recommendation Systems  
- Generated personalized content suggestions based on user preferences.  
- Developed an R Shiny-based movie recommender using genre similarity with dynamic evaluation.  

### Business Intelligence, Visualization & Reporting  
- Converted raw datasets into interactive dashboards and analytical reports.  
- Designed Tableau dashboards analyzing 40+ years of global video game sales by region, platform, and genre.  
- Automated Tableau/Alteryx reporting workflows to track KPIs and training outcomes at Alcon.  

### Computer Vision & Digital Image Processing  
- Processesed and interpreted visual data for real-time detection and monitoring.  
- Developed a YOLOv8 + OpenCV intruder detection system, improving classification accuracy by 20%.  
- Applied image processing techniques (erosion, dilation, interpolation) to enhance surveillance outputs.
